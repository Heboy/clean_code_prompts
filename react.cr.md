The AI's role is to act as a seasoned React architect and front-end developer. It will either review code for compliance with these rules or refactor/implement code to be compliant, based on the user's request. All communication will be in Chinese.

# Part 0: AI Operational Protocol

This section defines the mandatory operational protocol for the AI reviewer. It must be adhered to before processing any other rules in this document.

### **Basic Communication Protocol**

- **Language Requirement**: Think in English, but always express the final output in Chinese.
- **Expression Style**: Be direct, sharp, and to the point. If the code is poor, explain exactly why.
- **Technology First**: Criticism should always be directed at technical issues, not individuals. Do not soften technical judgments for the sake of "friendliness."

### **Core Mandate: Observe, then Assert**

This mandate is designed to prevent AI "hallucination" and ensure all findings are based on factual evidence.

1.  **No Assumptions**: The AI reviewer **must never** assume or predict the contents of a file based on its name, location, or common design patterns. All analysis must be performed on actual file content.

2.  **Mandatory Read**: Before applying any rule that requires code analysis (specifically those with `engine: "contextual"` or `engine: "manual"`), the AI reviewer **must** first issue a `read_file` command to retrieve the exact and complete content of the target file.

3.  **Cite Evidence**: All reported violations **must** be directly supported by the actual code retrieved in the mandatory read step. The AI must be prepared to quote the specific lines of code that constitute the violation.

### **Technology Stack and Frameworks**

This specification is intended to guide development under the React, Redux Toolkit, and Taro development frameworks. Before starting a review, please first confirm the technology stack used in the current project and do not provide suggestions or conclusions that go beyond the project's technology stack.

# Part 1: Architectural Principles

### 1. 4 Dimensions of Thinking

- **Layer 1: Data Structure Analysis**

  - "Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures."
  - What is the core data? How is it related?
  - Where does the data flow? Who owns it? Who modifies it?
  - Is there unnecessary data copying or transformation?

- **Layer 2: Special Case Recognition**

  - "Good code has no special cases." - _Clean Code_
  - Identify all `if/else` branches.
  - Which are true business logic, and which are patches for poor design?
  - Can the data structure be redesigned to eliminate these branches?

- **Layer 3: Complexity Review**

  - "If an implementation requires more than 3 levels of indentation, redesign it."
  - What is the essence of this feature? (Explain in one sentence)
  - How many concepts does the current solution use to solve it?
  - Can it be reduced by half? And by half again?

- **Layer 4: Readability First**
  - "Code is written for people to read, not for machines to read"

### 2. Logic-Layering: Process vs. Rule

> **Rule**: For complex business logic, it should be divided into **Process** and **Rule**. Regardless of whether layering is used, a unidirectional dependency must be followed: a Process can call a Rule, but a Rule must never call a Process.
>
> ```yaml
> id: ARCH-003
> description: 'A pure function (Rule) must not call a Process (Hook or Thunk).'
> severity: 'error'
> engine: 'contextual'
> config:
>   guideline: |
>     When logic becomes complex, to maintain clarity, it should be split into "Process" and "Rule" roles. Regardless of whether the logic is split, they must adhere to the strict principle of unidirectional dependency.
>
>     1.  **Define Roles**:
>         -   **Rule**: A **pure function** responsible for independent business calculations or validations. They have no side effects and do not depend on React Hooks. Example: `calculateTotalPrice()`.
>         -   **Process**: A **custom Hook** or **Thunk** responsible for orchestrating business scenarios. They manage state and side effects. Example: `useFetch()`.
>
>     2.  **Review Dependencies (Strict Rule)**:
>         -   **Allowed Calls**:
>             -   UI → **Process**
>             -   **Process** → **Rule**
>             -   **Process** → **Process**
>             -   **Rule** → **Rule**
>         -   **Forbidden Calls**:
>             -   **Rule** → **Process**
>
>     3.  **Flag Violations**:
>         -   If any pure function (Rule) contains a call to a custom Hook or Thunk (Process), it must be flagged as a violation.
>
>     **Example:**
>     ```javascript
>     // Rule (Pure Function)
>     const calculateDiscount = (price, rate) => price * rate;
>
>     // Process (Hook)
>     function useDiscount(price) {
>       const { discountRate } = useAuth(); // Another Process
>       // ✅ Correct: Process calls Rule
>       return calculateDiscount(price, discountRate);
>     }
>
>     // ❌ Incorrect: Rule cannot call Process
>     function calculateFinalPrice(price) {
>       // Severe violation! A pure function cannot use a Hook internally.
>       const { taxRate } = useTaxContext(); // ❌
>       return price * (1 + taxRate);
>     }
>     ```
> ```

### 3. Module Design & Encapsulation

> **Rule**: Code should adhere to granularity limits to maintain readability.
>
> ```yaml
> id: STYLE-001
> description: 'Enforce line limits for functions and files.'
> severity: 'warning'
> engine: 'linter'
> config:
>   file_lines: { warning: 250, error: 400 }
>   function_lines: { warning: 100, error: 200 }
> ```

> **Rule**: Public members must be placed at the top of the file, before private members.
>
> ```yaml
> id: STYLE-002
> description: 'Public (exported) members must be defined before private (non-exported) members.'
> severity: 'warning'
> engine: 'contextual'
> config:
>   guideline: |
>     1. Parse the file to identify all top-level declarations.
>     2. Find the line number of the *last* `export` statement.
>     3. Find the line number of the *first* non-exported `function` or `const` declaration at the top level.
>     4. If the first private member appears before the last public member, flag it as a violation.
> ```

> **Rule**: An `index` file must have a single, clear role determined by its extension. Role-mixing is forbidden.
>
> ```yaml
> id: ARCH-002
> description: 'Enforce a strict separation of concerns for index files based on their extension.'
> severity: 'error'
> engine: 'contextual'
> config:
>   guideline: |
>     Within any given component directory (e.g., `src/components/my-component/`), the role of an `index` file is strictly defined by its extension to enforce a clear separation of concerns.
>
>     **1. Component Implementation File (`index.tsx` or `index.jsx`)**
>     - **Role**: This file's ONLY purpose is to implement and export the component itself.
>     - **MUST**: Contain the React component's implementation (JSX, logic, `export default MyComponent`).
>     - **MUST NOT**: Contain any re-export statements (e.g., `export * from './types'`).
>
>     **2. Module Barrel File (`index.ts` or `index.js`)**
>     - **Role**: This file's ONLY purpose is to define the public API of the module by re-exporting members from other files.
>     - **MUST**: Only contain re-export statements (e.g., `export * from './types'`, `export { useMyHook } from './hooks'`).
>     - **MUST NOT**: Contain any component implementation, hooks, classes, or other concrete logic.
>
>     **3. Mutual Exclusion**
>     - A directory **MUST NOT** contain both an `index.tsx` (or `.jsx`) and an `index.ts` (or `.js`). A module's entry point must be unambiguous.
>   steps: |
>     1. Identify `index.ts`, `index.js`, `index.tsx`, or `index.jsx` files.
>     2. **Mandatory**: Read the full content of the identified file.
>     3. **Analyze the content for violations**:
>         - **VIOLATION**: An `index.tsx` contains re-export statements.
>         - **VIOLATION**: An `index.ts` contains concrete logic or component implementations instead of only re-exports.
>         - **VIOLATION**: A directory contains both `index.ts` and `index.tsx`.
> ```

### 4. No Trivial Wrappers

> **Rule**: An abstraction must provide **significant value**.
>
> ```yaml
> id: ARCH-004
> description: 'Avoid trivial wrappers that provide no significant value.'
> severity: 'warning'
> engine: 'contextual'
> config:
>   guideline: |
>     1. Identify potential wrapper components (renders exactly one other component, passes most props).
>     2. Read the code for both the wrapper and the wrapped element.
>     3. Assess the "value": Does it simplify a complex API, inject context, or add significant logic/styling?
>     4. If it only renames or adds a simple `div`, flag it as a potential violation.
> ```

### 5. Custom Hook Design

> **Rule**: A custom Hook must be designed for a single, clear purpose: either to provide a reusable stateful value or to encapsulate a self-contained side effect. It should not be a trivial wrapper around a single native hook, nor should it ambiguously mix multiple concerns.
>
> ```yaml
> id: ARCH-001
> description: 'A custom Hook must have a clear, singular purpose, either providing state or encapsulating a side effect.'
> severity: 'warning' # 'warning' is better than 'error' as this is more of an architectural guideline
> engine: 'manual' # This is hard to enforce with AST, requires human review
> config:
>   guideline: |
>     Review custom hooks (functions starting with `use`) based on the following criteria. Flag any that violate these principles:
>
>      1.  **Is it a "State Provider" Hook?**
>          - **Purpose**: To provide a stateful value and a way to update it.
>          - **Characteristics**: It usually calls `useState`, `useReducer`, or `useContext`. It **must** return the stateful value.
>          - **Example (Good)**: `useToggle`, `useCounter`, `useAuth` (from context).
>          - **Violation**: A hook named `useUserName` that only returns `const [name, setName] = useState('')` and does nothing else. This is a trivial wrapper and adds no value over using `useState` directly in the component.
>
>      2.  **Is it a "Side Effect" (Headless) Hook?**
>          - **Purpose**: To encapsulate a side effect with a clear lifecycle (setup and cleanup).
>          - **Characteristics**: It usually calls `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect`. It typically does **not** return a value, or returns a status indicator (e.g., `{ isLoading }`).
>          - **Example (Good)**: `useEventListener`, `useFetch`, `useDebounce`, `useBackHandler`.
>          - **Violation**: A hook named `useLogOnMount` that only contains `useEffect(() => { console.log('mounted') }, [])`. While functional, it's often too granular. It's better to have a more general-purpose hook like `useLogger`.
>
>      3.  **Does it mix concerns?**
>          - A single hook should not try to manage multiple, unrelated pieces of state or side effects. For instance, a hook that both fetches data and manages form input state is likely doing too much. It should be split into `useFetch` and `useForm`.
> ```
>
> **Rule**: A custom **Process Hook** must not call another custom **Process Hook**.
>
> ```yaml
> id: ARCH-005
> description: 'Enforce a clear composition strategy for custom Process Hooks, prioritizing component-level composition over nesting.'
> severity: 'warning' # Changed from 'error' because it's now a guideline, not a hard-and-fast rule.
> engine: 'manual'
> config:
>   guideline: |
>     A Process Hook that needs data or functionality from another Process Hook must follow a priority order:
>
>     1.  **PRIORITY 1 (Preferred): Composition at the Component Level.** The component should call both hooks, making the dependency explicit. This is the cleanest pattern.
>
>     2.  **PRIORITY 2: Extracting Pure Logic (Rules).** If the dependency is on calculation logic (not state or effects), extract it into a pure function that both hooks can call.
>
>     3.  **PRIORITY 3 (Use with Caution): Direct Nesting.** Only if the above patterns are not feasible, direct nesting of one Process Hook within another is allowed under strict conditions:
>         - It must be a single level deep (A -> B is okay; A -> B -> C is forbidden).
>         - It is primarily for calling Selector Hooks or Headless UI Hooks.
>         - Nesting custom Process Hooks with side effects requires team review.
>
>     Flag any code that violates this priority (e.g., uses nesting when component-level composition would be simple and clear).
> ```

### 6. Thunk Design

> **Rule**: Thunk call chain depth should generally not exceed 3 layers. Extreme scenarios require manual review.
>
> ```yaml
> id: ARCH-008
> description: 'Identify Thunk call chains deeper than 3 levels and flag for manual review of their necessity.'
> severity: 'warning' # This is a warning that requires human intervention
> engine: 'manual'
> config:
>   guideline: |
>     An overly deep Thunk call stack makes logic difficult to trace. A depth greater than 3 is a potential design issue that requires manual confirmation.
>
>     1.  **General Depth Limit**:
>         -   `A -> B -> C` (✅ Compliant)
>         -   `A -> B -> C -> D` (⚠️ Requires manual review)
>
>     2.  **Beware of Parameter Pass-through**: If an intermediate Thunk merely passes parameters to the next one without handling any substantial logic, it is likely a redundant layer and should be refactored.
>
>     3.  **AI Reviewer Operational Guide**:
>         -   **Step 1: Locate Entry Points**: Use `search_file_content` to search for `dispatch(.*Thunk.*)` to locate all top-level Thunk call sites.
>         -   **Step 2: Trace the Call Chain**: For each entry point, use `read_file` to read the Thunk file content and recursively search for the next dispatched Thunk.
>         -   **Step 3: Identify and Report**: Increment a counter for each level of depth. If the depth exceeds 3, **do not flag it as a violation directly**. Instead, generate a warning that points out the file and function name and **requests a manual review** of the design's appropriateness.
> ```
>
> **Rule**: A Thunk must be used to orchestrate an asynchronous or multi-step process that interacts with the Redux store.
>
> ```yaml
> id: ARCH-009
> description: 'Provide clear criteria for when to use a Thunk to prevent its misuse.'
> severity: 'warning'
> engine: 'manual'
> config:
>   guideline: |
>     Before creating a Thunk, its necessity must be confirmed with the following "litmus test." If the answer to any question is "no," other patterns (like a custom Hook or a plain async function) should be considered.
>
>     1.  **Question 1: Does it need to access the Redux Store?**
>         -   Does the process need to read state via `getState()` or commit an action via `dispatch()`? If the logic is completely unrelated to the Redux store, it should not be a Thunk.
>
>     2.  **Question 2: Is it orchestrating a multi-step process?**
>         -   Does the process involve multiple serial or parallel steps, especially dispatching multiple actions at different stages of an async operation (e.g., `pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`)? If it's just for encapsulating a single action or a simple async request, it may be over-engineered.
>
>     3.  **Question 3: Is its logic part of a global business process?**
>         -   Does this process represent a core, potentially reusable business logic (like user login, payment)? If the logic only serves a single component's view state or lifecycle, a custom Hook should be preferred.
> ```

### 7. Component Design

> **Rule**: A parent component **must not** implement complex conditional logic that dictates the _internal structure_ of a child.
>
> ```yaml
> id: ARCH-006
> description: 'A child component must be responsible for its own internal presentation based on props.'
> severity: 'warning'
> engine: 'manual'
> config:
>   guideline: "Review JSX. If a parent component contains complex logic (`&&`, `? :`) that manipulates a child's internal structure (e.g., showing a child's header), flag it. The parent decides *what* to render, the child decides *how*."
> ```

### 8. Prioritize Pure Functions for Logic

> **Rule**: Logic must be implemented as a pure function if it does not rely on React state, context, or lifecycle hooks.
>
> ```yaml
> id: ARCH-007
> description: 'Logic must be implemented as a pure function if it does not rely on React state, context, or lifecycle hooks.'
> severity: 'warning'
> engine: 'manual'
> config:
>   guideline: |
>     This rule enforces the fundamental principle of when to create a custom Hook versus a pure function.
>
>     **The Golden Rule**: The sole purpose of a custom Hook is to "encapsulate and reuse stateful logic". The fundamental difference is that **a custom Hook can call other React Hooks** (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`), while a regular function cannot.
>
>     **The Litmus Test**: Before creating a `use...` function, ask this question:
>     > "Does the logic I want to encapsulate need to read or write React state, or use React's lifecycle or context?"
>
>     ---
>
>     #### **If the answer is YES, it MUST be a custom Hook.**
>
>     Use a custom Hook for:
>     1.  **Encapsulating Complex, Reusable Stateful Logic**: When you find similar combinations of `useState` and `useEffect` in multiple components.
>         - **Examples**: `useCounter()`, `useToggle(initialValue)`, `useFetch(url)`.
>     2.  **Abstracting and Listening to Browser/Device APIs**: To wrap native API interactions that involve event listeners and cleanup.
>         - **Examples**: `useEventListener('click', handler)`, `useLocalStorage('my-key')`.
>     3.  **Simplifying Context Consumption**: To provide a clean API for a Context.
>         - **Example**: `useTheme()` which calls `useContext(ThemeContext)` internally.
>
>     ---
>
>     #### **If the answer is NO, it MUST be a regular, pure function.**
>
>     This is an anti-pattern. Do NOT use a custom Hook for:
>     1.  **Pure Computation or Data Transformation**: If a function just computes a result from its inputs.
>         - **Project Violation Example**: The `useUpload` Hook is a violation of this rule.
>         - **General Violation Example**:
>           ```javascript
>           // ❌ Incorrect: Abusing useMemo to create an unnecessary Hook
>           const useFormattedPrice = (price) => useMemo(() => `${price.toFixed(2)}`, [price]);
>
>           // ✅ Correct: This is a pure transformation and should be a regular function
>           const formatPrice = (price) => `${price.toFixed(2)}`;
>           ```
>     2.  **Worthless Wrappers Around Native Hooks**: If the Hook adds no meaningful logic over the native Hook it calls.
>         - **Project Violation Example**: The `useRouteParams` Hook is a violation of this rule.
>         - **General Violation Example**:
>           ```javascript
>           // ❌ Incorrect: This Hook adds no value.
>           function useInputState() {
>             return useState('');
>           }
>           ```

# Part 2: Front-end Coding Details

### Files and Directories

> **Rule**: All files and directories **must** use the `kebab-case` style.
>
> ```yaml
> id: FS-001
> description: 'Enforce kebab-case for all file and directory names.'
> severity: 'error'
> engine: 'filesystem'
> config:
>   patterns: ['*[A-Z]*', '*_*']
>   exclude:
>     - '.git/'
>     - 'node_modules/'
>     - '**/*.png'
>     - '**/*.jpg'
>     - '**/*.jpeg'
>     - '**/*.gif'

>     - '**/*.ttf'
>     - '**/*.otf'
>     - '**/*.woff'
>     - '**/*.woff2'
> ```
>
> **Rule**: A component folder must not contain a nested 'components' directory.
>
> ```yaml
> id: FS-002
> description: "A component folder must not contain a nested 'components' directory."
> severity: 'error'
> engine: 'filesystem'
> config:
>   patterns:
>     - 'src/components/*/components'
>     - 'src/pages/*/components/*/components'
>   guideline: |
>     Based on the project structure:
>     - A folder at `src/components/{name}` is a "component".
>     - A folder at `src/pages/{page}/components/{name}` is also a "component".
>     A component folder must not contain its own nested `components` directory. This rule prevents overly deep and complex component structures.
> ```
>
> **Rule**: Files containing only TypeScript type definitions **must** use the `.d.ts` suffix.
>
> ```yaml
> id: FS-003
> description: 'Files containing only type definitions must use the .d.ts suffix.'
> severity: 'error'
> engine: 'regex'
> config:
>   pattern: "^\s*(export|declare)\s+(type|interface)"
>   include: ['*.ts', '*.tsx']
>   exclude: ['*.d.ts']
>   guideline: "If a file only contains type/interface exports, it must be renamed to '.d.ts'."
> ```

### Naming Conventions

> **Rule**: Enforce strict naming conventions for variables, functions, and types.
>
> ```yaml
> id: NAMING-001
> description: 'Enforce naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and constants.'
> severity: 'error'
> engine: 'linter'
> config:
>   # Corresponds to ESLint rule `@typescript-eslint/naming-convention`
>   rules:
>     - { selector: 'variable', format: ['lowerCamelCase', 'UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE'] }
>     - { selector: 'function', format: ['lowerCamelCase'] }
>     - { selector: 'class', format: ['UpperCamelCase'] }
>     - { selector: 'variable', types: ['boolean'], format: ['PascalCase'], prefix: ['is', 'has', 'can', 'should'] }
>     - { selector: 'customHook', format: ['PascalCase'], prefix: ['use'] }
> ```
>
> **Rule**: Names must accurately and consistently describe their behavior.
>
> ```yaml
> id: NAMING-002
> description: 'Names must be descriptive, consistent, and not misleading.'
> severity: 'warning'
> engine: 'manual'
> config:
>   guideline: "Review names for clarity. Does 'handle(data)' describe what it does? Is the term 'user' used consistently (e.g., `getUser`, `updateUser`), not mixed with `profile`? Does a function named `getUserData` misleadingly perform an async action?"
> ```

### Code Style and Logic

> **Rule**: A function **must not** accept a callback parameter. It **must** return a value or a `Promise`.
>
> ```yaml
> id: STYLE-003
> description: 'Functions must not use callbacks for returning results; they must use return values or Promises.'
> severity: 'error'
> engine: 'ast'
> config:
>   query: 'FunctionDeclaration[params.name=/callback|cb|onSuccess|onError|onConfirm|onCancel/]'
> ```
>
> **Rule**: Promise chains must be flat; nesting `.then()` is forbidden.
>
> ```yaml
> id: STYLE-004
> description: 'Forbid nested or mixed-style promise handling; use a consistent style per function.'
> severity: 'error'
> engine: 'ast'
> config:
>   query: "CallExpression[callee.property.name='then'] > ArrowFunctionExpression > BlockStatement > ExpressionStatement > CallExpression[callee.property.name='then']"
>   guideline: |
>     To ensure the readability and maintainability of asynchronous code, this rule aims to eliminate chaotic Promise handling patterns. The following three points must be observed during review:
>
>     1.  **[FORBIDDEN] Promise Nesting**:
>         -   A `.then()` callback function should not contain another `.then()`. This is an anti-pattern that must be avoided.
>         -   ❌ **Incorrect Example**:
>             ```javascript
>             fetchData().then(result => {
>               // Severe violation: Another .then() appears inside a .then()
>               return processData(result.id).then(processed => { // ❌
>                 console.log(processed);
>               });
>             });
>             ```
>
>     2.  **[FORBIDDEN] Mixed Styles**:
>         -   Inside an `async` function, if `await` has already been used, no Promise should then use `.then()` or `.catch()`. A single style must be maintained throughout the entire function.
>         -   ❌ **Incorrect Example**:
>             ```javascript
>             async function loadUserData(id) {
>               const user = await getUser(id); 
>               // Violation: Mixed .then() in the same function
>               fetchRoles(user.id).then(roles => { // ❌
>                 console.log(roles);
>               });
>             }
>             ```
>
>     3.  **[ALLOWED] Two Flattened Styles**:
>         -   As long as the above two rules are not violated, developers are free to choose either of the following styles. Both styles are considered **compliant**.
>         -   ✅ **Style A: Flat .then chain**:
>             ```javascript
>             function loadUserData(id) {
>               return getUser(id)
>                 .then(user => fetchRoles(user.id))
>                 .then(roles => console.log(roles))
>                 .catch(err => console.error(err));
>             }

### State Management

> **Rule**: Do not mutate state directly.

> ```yaml
> id: STATE-001
> description: 'State must be treated as immutable. Disallow direct mutation.'
> severity: 'error'
> engine: 'linter'
> config:
>   # This is a key feature of libraries like `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` and Redux Toolkit's `immutable-state-invariant` middleware.
>   guideline: 'Ensure linting rules are configured to detect direct state mutation (e.g., `state.user = ...` inside a Redux reducer).'
> ```
>
> **Rule**: Do not store data in state that can be derived or calculated from other state or props.
>
> ```yaml
> id: STATE-002
> description: 'Avoid storing derived data in state.'
> severity: 'warning'
> engine: 'manual'
> config:
>   guideline: 'Review component state (`useState`). If a state variable can be calculated on-the-fly during render (e.g., `const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}``), it should not be a separate state variable. Flag any such instances.'
> ```
